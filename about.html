        <h1>About The Embroidery Stories (Table Cloth)</h1>
        <p>
          Welcome to the Embroidery Stories website! This site is designed to be a collection of stories as told by the contibutors to the emboidered table cloth. Our mission is to communicate what is important to each contibutor about their place on the land, while sharing stories and passion through every stitch.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Our Journey</h2>
        <p>
          Started as a few small images, the table cloth has evolved into a community that connects over our shared experiences with the land and symbols from our lives. From pre-pandemic to today's novel experiences, we've come a long way. Each piece tells a story, woven through thread and creativity.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Meet the Contibutors</h2>
        <p>
          The storytellers are a diverse group of passionate individuals who share a love for art and placemaking. We work together to create meaning, one stitch at a time.
